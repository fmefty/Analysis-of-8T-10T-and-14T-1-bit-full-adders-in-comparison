# Analysis-of-8T-10T-and-14T-1-bit-full-adders-in-comparison


**INTRODUCTION**
• A full adder is an important component in digital circuits used to perform addition operations.
• In recent years, various low-power full adder designs have been proposed for VLSI applications.
• The 8T, 10T and 14T full adders are some of the popular low-power full adder designs.
• These full adders differ in terms of their transistor count and layout area, and each has its own advantages and limitations.
• The analysis of these full adders will help in determining which design is most suitable for specific VLSI applications.
• The aim of this presentation is to compare the performance of these four full adders and identify which design offers the best trade-off between power consumption, delay, and layout area.

**Description**
In this project, we incorporated a Full Adder, providing its truth table and Logic Diagram as fundamental components. 
Subsequently, we designed 8T, 10T, and 14T Full Adder's Circuit Diagrams, along with Schematics using Cadence Virtuoso. We conducted Input-Output Graph analysis, computed Delay and Average Power, and ensured Layout compliance with No DRC (Design Rule Check) violations. Finally, we meticulously compared the performance of these three configurations, presenting our findings in a comprehensive Comparison Table.

**CONCLUSION**
• The performance analysis of 1-bit full adders is an important research area in the field of VLSI design.
• In this study, we compared the 8T, 10T and 14T full adders using various metrics, including power consumption, delay, and area.
• Our simulation results showed that the 10T full adder had the lowest power consumption and delay, while the 8T full adder had the smallest area.
• The choice of the best full adder for a particular application depends on the design requirements and constraints.
• Overall, the analysis of 1-bit full adders is critical for the development of efficient and high-performance digital circuits in VLSI design.
